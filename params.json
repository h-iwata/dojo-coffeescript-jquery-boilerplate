Have fun !","body":"#dojo-coffeescript-jquery-boilerplate\r\n\r\nThe dojo-coffeescript-jquery-boilerplate is aimed at the best practice for the develop enviroment \r\nwith dojo for baseframework, jquery for dom operation, and coffeescript as languages.\r\n\r\n##Quick Start\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/h-iwata/dojo-coffeescript-jquery-boilerplate.git`.\r\n2. `cd dojo-coffeescript-jquery-boilerplate/javascripts` for move into the directory, then run `npm install`\r\n3. run `./tools/startCoffeeWatch.sh`, which will compiles demo codes in `./coffee` and place it into the `./src` folder.\r\n4. run `node javascripts/tools/startTestServer.js` for starting test server, then open `localhost:3000/` in your favorite browser. See how the HelloDojoButton works. \r\n5. Develop your project in `./coffee` until it is amazing.\r\n6. run `./tools/build/startBuild.sh`, which will create an awesome optimised build in the `./release` directory.\r\n8. Upload `/javascripts/release` and `/javascripts/config.js` for millions of people the world over to enjoy.\r\n9. Hapyness.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n* The dojo toolkit via CDN (the dojo files in your local directory are only used for build and test).\r\n* Custormized build script from [dojo-boilerplate](https://github.com/csnover/dojo-boilerplate), \r\n    which build app in a release folder, delete .uncompressed files, and remove dojo local files in the directory, then rewrite config.js to remove debug mode.\r\n* Light weight node server for test run.\r\n* TDD!\r\n\r\n## How you create new pages from this?\r\nTo be optimized build, you should create a controller in a page as a main script. \r\nIn the controller, require all Widgets used in the page .\r\nthen add the controller name to `/tools/build/profile.js` as follows\r\n```\r\nlayers: {\r\n\t'App/Controllers/Index' :{},\r\n\t'App/Controllers/#{createdControllerName}' :{},`\r\n},\r\n```\r\nAfter build, you will see all modules required in a controller is now complessed into a single controller file.\r\nbut you don't have to change any codes.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nAnyone is welcome.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
